# Simple web application in Go

This repo is a fork of [lets-go](https://github.com/michaeldegli/lets-go) repo created after a book ["Let's Go!"](http://www.alexedwards.net/lets-go/sample/) by Alex Edwards.

This fork is refactored according to DDD principles and my thoughts of what is best practices. My main aim was to practice Go programming language and common Go technology stack of a web app.
